# Security policy

Even though this project is focused on security, it is still prone to possible vulnerabilities. We consider every security bug as a serious issue and will try our best to address it.

## Responsible disclosure

If you have found a security bug, please send us an email at security \[@\] bunkerity.com with technical details so we can resolve it as soon as possible.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of issues we consider as high risk :
- Vulnerability in the code
- Bypass of a security feature
- Vulnerability in a third-party dependency
- Risk in the supply chain

## Bounty

To encourage responsible disclosure, we may reward you with a bounty at the sole discretion of the maintainers.
